Snapshot
========

Snapshot an iOS app screen and convert it into a PSD file.
It is then very easy to edit a few assets and iterate, rather than grab assets from a monolithic screenshot.
A UX designer could also use this exploded view of the app to prototype animations with [Framer](http://framerjs.com/) or [Origami](http://facebook.github.io/origami/). Translation would also be easier with a WYSIWYG interface.

Todo:

* restore the whole hierarchy in the PSD file
* support transforms
* support rounded rects
* support layer shadows / shadow path
* support content mode and stretchable images
* support alpha
* support layer masks
* support shape layers
* support text layers
* name the layer groups
